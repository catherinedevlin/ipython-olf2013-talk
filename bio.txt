A freak accident in 2000 transformed Catherine from a chemical engineering grad student to a database administrator and sometimes reluctant sysadmin, but she didn't gain superpowers until she picked up Python in 2003.  She was PyOhio's first chair and currently leads the Dayton Dynamic Languages group.  She works for Dell KACE, speaks around the region, blogs at catherinedevlin.blogspot.com, and releases code at github.com/catherinedevlin.
